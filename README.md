Jokes app in react native sample
This code uses the useState hook to keep track of the jokes and the current joke index.
The JokesApp component displays the current joke and a "Next Joke" button. When the button is pressed,
the handleNextJoke function is called, which updates the current joke index and displays the next joke.
